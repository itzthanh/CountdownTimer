# CountdownTimer

Simple app I created as I'm starting to learn ReactJS. User enters in Month, Date, Year and a timer will display the remaining Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds left until the inputed date.

source code can be found in /src/

Edit: After uploading, it appears that my CSS broke and at the moment I have not figured out the cause.
